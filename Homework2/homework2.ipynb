    "The goal is to decide whether or not to approve a loan to a new client based on the predictors that are provided. If you predict a 1, that means that you are predicting that the customer will pay back the laon. The data columns are described in the MetaData.csv file. The response for training is the MIS_Status column, where PIF = paid in full = a successful loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll evaluate using the mean F1 score (see the Kaggle overview page for more information). Mean F1 scores closer to 1 are better scores. On the leaderboard I've included a benchmark which I created by randomly predicting 0 or 1 for the test data set (see random.guess on the leaderboard)."
